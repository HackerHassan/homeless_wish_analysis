# Homeless Wish Analysis
**If you had 3 wishes, what would they be?** <br>

This is an analysis on the 3 wishes asked by the founder of Invisible People Mark. `Please keep in mind that many of these wishes have been generalized in order to allow for the aggregation of wishes in order to see trends.` If you would like to see the non-generalized wishes, you can watch the videos here: https://invisiblepeople.tv/stories<br>

**How were these 100 people selected?**
- I chose these people based on randomness and worked my way backwards from the fist page and kept clicking view older videos. 

**Different relationships to explore**
- `most common wishes`
- `most unique wishes`
- `most common locations`
- `age group bins` ~ these are very subjective as I eyeballed the people and placed them in age bins based on looks, but being homeless ages people faster and therefore there may be some errors
- `Gender and wishes`
- `Race and wishes`
- `Age group and wishes`

## Summary Statistics
Top 3 Wishes:
1. Find a Home
2. See family (children, parents, loved-ones)
3. Find a job

## Final Remarks
From this we can learn that most homeless people have nothing and want the bare minimum. It makes one wonder whether we are looking at the world in the right way. From this analysis, it can be seen that `those who have the least ask for the least, and those who have the most ask for even more.`
